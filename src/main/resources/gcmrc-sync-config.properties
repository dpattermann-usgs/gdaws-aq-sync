# This is a sample file.  The real file can be in one of a few places (searched in order)
# 1. /datausgs/projects/gdaws-aq-sync/config (The development path - If developing, you can put it here)
# 2. (When deployed as a jar) Next to the running Jar file
# 3. ~/gdaws-aq-sync/config - The home directory of the user running the application (easy fall back if probing for the jar path fails)
